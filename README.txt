 Created and maintained by copygirl.

See CREDITS.txt for a list of mods included in the pack.
See Changelog.txt for changes made between versions.


Warning! This modpack is inspired by Vanilla Minecraft and
pretty difficult. It contains a silly amount of recipe changes
to make progression more difficult and meaningful. Hopefully,
you can enjoy Minecraft a little bit longer this way!

Check the "Getting Started" guide for some tips:

The obsidian Modpack is highly experimental and will never be
truly finished, but you're welcome to join the discussion and
help developing the pack. We also have a somewhat official
server for both playing and testing.

For some help on installing the pack manually, or using the
Pack[OP]dater, which is necessary to play the latest and
greatest in-development version of the pack, see here:
