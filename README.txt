= Introduction =

Warning! This modpack is inspired by Vanilla Minecraft and
pretty difficult. It contains a silly amount of recipe changes
to make progression more difficult and meaningful.
Playing on HARDCORE is recommended for added FUN factor!
Playing with FRIENDS is recommended if you have any...

Flaxbeard's Steam Power and Thaumcraft are added as end-game
content. Thaumcraft has not been tweaked much yet.


Getting FastCraft is recommended:

If your computer can handle it, you could grab Better Foliage:

= Flint =
To get flint, which is required for stone tools, you have to use
a shovel to break gravel. The lower the harvest level on the tool,
the higher the chance for it to drop flint.

= Crafting Station =
Many recipes, most notably iron tools, armor and other things
required for progressing, use BetterStorage's crafting station. To
make it, you might be required to blow up gold and redstone ore if
you can't find another way to get these resources.

= Food =
There's 6 different food groups in this pack: Meat, Fish, Fruit,
Shrooms, Veggie Stuff and Bread'n'Stuff (which includes cookies, cake
and pumpkin pie). After eating about two hunger bars worth of food
from a single food group, that food's nutrition value will go down.
For a healthy diet, I recommend having 3 to 4 food sources ready. I
suppose you could also use rotten flesh to get the food out of your
system, though it's up to your imagination how that works.

= Animals =
Breeding and growing up of animals takes 4 times longer than normal.
It takes 1 day until you can breed them again, and baby animals take
4 days to grow up. On the upside, you do get additional experience
when doing this!
* Chickens are an exception, they only take twice as long.
* Pigs will spawn two baby piglets. How cute!

= Planks & Sticks =
Using axes together with logs / planks when crafting will result in
more planks / sticks. You can also break down some items back into
planks / sticks this way.

= Slabs & Stairs =
You can turn two slabs or a stair back into a full block. Also, the
stair recipe gives 6 stairs instead of just 4.
